# NMT_repetitions
A study of the cause of repetitions in NMT involving morphologically rich languages. For now, the study is restricted to English - Tamil Machine Translation. 

### Requirements:

Tensorflow 2.15 
Keras 2.15
keras\_nlp, keras\_cv
tensorflow\_text

### Moved to PyTorch for now because tensorflow test script creates segmentation fault. Feel free to make changes if you can. I didn't want to look inside keras GreedySampler() to fix this for now!
